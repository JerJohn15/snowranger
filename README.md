 


## Team Codename Snowranger
We're working to integrate existing 311 data and services with user-generated advisories in an effort to enable, and make transparent, systems for mainaining civilized life. 

Originally begun as an initiative to help enable mobility for low-mobility folk in times of inclement weather (thus: Snowranger), or project has widened in scope to take into consideration the warmer months as well, along with an acknowledgement that mobility, more broadly considered, means __access__. 

Existing 311 data references civil complaints of all kinds - from rodent issues to graffitti to potholes to snowplow requests - all of which can make an impact on the accessibility and living conditions in our fair city.
